    text: You have been walking for days on your way to Bleblob, the largest town
      in the region.  At long last you can see the towers of Bleblob towering over
      the hills in the distance. The path stretches out in front of you as you prepare
      for this day's journey. After several hours of walking you come to one of the
      large rivers that surround Bleblob.  Where you stand the trail slipts into two
      paths, one going to your right towards what appears to be a lake, and one going
      to your left towards a bridge.  The bridge looks relatively sturdy and well
      kept.  The logs it's made out of appear polished and they sparkle as you tilt
      your head to look at them. The lake to your right looks less inviting, but the
      path towards it is well troden and confident.  From what you can see of the
      lake it doesn't look particularly large, and might provide an alternative path
      accross the river.

      the water in the old willow tree's shade.  They paddle in circles occasionally
      dipping their heads into the water. On the other side of the lake appears to
      be another bridge, this one more elaborate than the last. Small water wheels
      hang from the bottom of the bridge, slowly turning in the water below. As the
      trail comes upto the old willow tree you notice that tree several carefully
      cut gems are embedded into the bark of the tree.

      Hey, why are you stealing from the king?\u201D Before you can fully understand\
      \ what just happened they\u2019ve put you into a jail cell. After a few minutes\
      \ a frog walks in and sits in front of your cell \u201CSo, I hear that you have\
      \ been involved in quite the heist. Odd that you would be an outsider partaking\
      \ in such an event so I would like to hear your side.\u201D You proceed to tell\
      \ him you have no idea what just happened and that you were looped into the\
      \ entire mess. After hearing your side of the story, the frog decides to let\
      \ you go stating \u201CI believe you; however, you cannot come back to our city\
      \ until we get this under control. Sorry, but you must leave.\u201D He has you\
      \ leave the cell and you progress back to the outside world and think that you\
      \ probably shouldn\u2019t get involved with anything else today."

      blinded by the light until you recognize your surroundings. You have managed
      to take a very roundabout way into the town.
