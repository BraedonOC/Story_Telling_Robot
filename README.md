# Story Telling Robot
This repository contains the code for a robot that tells an interactive "choose your own adventure story".
The code was developed by group 2B for CSCI 436.
## Usage
To use this code it's important to have the Python NAO SDK properly installed and configured.  
Once the SDK is configured you should be able to use our code by running:
`python2 story_telling_robot --ip <ip address of NAO>`
By default, our robot will tell the story that we wrote, however this can be changed by using the `--story` flag.
