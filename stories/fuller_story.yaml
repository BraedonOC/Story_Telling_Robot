            text: You have been walking for days on your way to Bleblob, 
                    the largest town in the region.  At long last you can 
                    see the towers of Bleblob towering over the hills in the distance.  
                    The path stretches out in front of you as you prepare for this day's 
                    journey.  
                    After several hours of walking you come to one of the large rivers that 
                    surround Bleblob.  Where you stand the trail slipts into two paths, one going 
                    to your right towards what appears to be a lake, and one going to your left towards 
                    a bridge.  The bridge looks relatively sturdy and well kept.  The logs it's made out 
                    of appear polished and they sparkle as you tilt your head to look at them.  
                    The lake to your right looks less inviting, but the path towards it is well troden 
                    and confident.  From what you can see of the lake it doesn't look particularly large, 
                    and might provide an alternative path accross the river.

    question: Do you 
                want to go left to the bridge or right towards the lake?

You continue along the tunnel, delving deeper into the system all the while stepping carefully as to not slip on the slime coating the interior of the sewer. As you go in further you begin to feel a slight vibration under your feet however, you are unable to fully make out where it is coming from. Eager to continue towards the source, you rush forwards down the straight hallway until you come to a branch. To your left is a tunnel that is constantly dripping, you can hear the plops of water from deep in the cave and reason there must be much more water further in. On the right, it looks as if the cave is getting shorter, the ceiling steadily comes down and you'll be forced to crawl through.

The volume of the plopping of water continues to increase, completely drowning out your thoughts as you continue into the tunnel. You think of turning around and heading back where you came from because it is getting to be unbearable, but right as you convince yourself to go back it stops . . . You stop, amazed at how suddenly it got silent as you look forwards and get your bearings. Shining your light, you see a small entrance, eager to get away, you head towards it. Once you go through the entrance you step into a magnificent cavern with massive stalactites hanging from the ceiling over a huge pool. The water in it is incredibly still

Despite the pain, you push through until you make it to an opening. Right as you stand back up and turn to look at where you came through the tunnel behind you collapses. You take a second to survey your surroundings and see two possible ways for you to go now that you cannot go back.
