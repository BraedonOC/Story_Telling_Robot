            text: You have been walking for days on your way to Bleblob, 
                    the largest town in the region.  At long last you can 
                    see the towers of Bleblob towering over the hills in the distance.  
                    The path stretches out in front of you as you prepare for this day's 
                    journey.  
                    After several hours of walking you come to one of the large rivers that 
                    surround Bleblob.  Where you stand the trail slipts into two paths, one going 
                    to your right towards what appears to be a lake, and one going to your left towards 
                    a bridge.  The bridge looks relatively sturdy and well kept.  The logs it's made out 
                    of appear polished and they sparkle as you tilt your head to look at them.  
                    The lake to your right looks less inviting, but the path towards it is well troden 
                    and confident.  From what you can see of the lake it doesn't look particularly large, 
                    and might provide an alternative path accross the river.

    question: Do you 
                want to go left to the bridge or right towards the lake?

You continue along the tunnel, delving deeper into the system all the while stepping carefully as to not slip on the slime coating the interior of the sewer. As you go in further you begin to feel a slight vibration under your feet; however, you are unable to fully make out where it is coming from. Eager to continue towards the source, you rush forwards down the straight hallway until you come to a branch. To your left is a tunnel that is constantly dripping, you can hear the “plops” of water from deep in the cave and reason there must be much more water further in. On the right, it looks as if the cave is getting shorter, the ceiling steadily comes down and you’ll be forced to crawl through.

The volume of the “plopping” of water continues to increase, completely drowning out your thoughts as you continue into the tunnel. You think of turning around and heading back where you came from because it is getting to be unbearable, but right as you convince yourself to go back it stops . . . You stop, amazed at how suddenly it got silent as you look forwards and get your bearings. Shining your light, you see a small entrance, eager to get away, you head towards it.

You take a second to survey your surroundings and see two possible ways for you to go now that you cannot go back.

You are stunned before you can even think the frog booms “What do you think you are doing?” Without giving you time to respond, the frog bellows “why have intruded into my domain? Do you think you can just come into my kingdom and steal from me? Don’t you know I’m the frog king?” You step back in awe as the frog king approaches you. “I am very sorry to do this to you, but you must exit my domain” As soon as he has finished speaking, you are lifted by a geyser of water and pushed out of the sewers.

As you climb out of the water, you look back into it, only to see a massive object making its way to the surface behind you. You watch petrified, as it surfaces smoothly, hardly making a ripple in the serene waters. It takes you a second to fully comprehend what has emerged, but you soon realize that it is a massive frog with a tiny crown upon its head. It points to you and says “I have not seen a being like you in quite some time, usually we don’t happen upon curious individuals. You are, of course, free to roam my city as you please. Just don’t make too much trouble for my loyal citizens.” He hands you a pin and tells you “that should get you past the guards, please enjoy yourself.” However, as soon as you leave, the king stops you by asking “Would you do me a favor? A week ago someone stole a gem from me similar to the one you saw in the pool. Would you be willing to help me find it, maybe you’ll have more luck with an outside perspective”

            text:   You decide to stay for the rest of the conversation with the frog, after all you have not done anything wrong. The frog turns to you and says “Hello stranger, I am the frog king. I’ve ruled these parts for quite some time, yet I’ve only seen a few of your kind. What brings you this way?” Stunned by the size of the frog floating before you, you are unable to utter a word. Filling the gap in conversation the king picks up stating “Whatever brings you here, I am certain we should not be so quick to judge you. After all you haven’t done anything wrong.” You start to feel a bit relieved, as he continues “I do apologize for this inconvenience, you are free to enjoy the sights of my city, I just ask that you do not make too much trouble for my citizens. Please enjoy yourself. Oh and next time, please use the other door.“ You are free to go now; however, as soon as go to leave, the king stops you by asking “Would you be willing to do me a favor? A week ago someone stole a gem from me similar to this one.” He quickly dives down and produces a massive gem that seems to be emitting light held on a pedestal with a small circle engraving. “Would you be willing to help me find it? my guards have been searching for quite some time and maybe you’ll have more luck with your outside perspective”

You finally make it to the front of the line you are met with a teller at the desk who says “Hello, how may I help you?” You ask about any suspicious activities, more specifically if anyone deposited something massive lately or put a ton of money in an account recently. The teller just gives you a bland “no” and tells you “look, I can’t tell you anything about our clients if you want any information about stuff like that you’ll have to move elsewhere.” 

    question: Now that you’ve ran into that dead end, would you like to continue your search at the market or return to the king to ask for help?

Walking from stall to stall you even witness a man sell his entire stall, including the stall that housed the stuff. The buyer then just hops behind the stall and begins to sell his newly acquired stock. You walk up to the man and inquire about any gems being sold. He says “Yeah, of course I know all about gems, see! Look at my selection. I have anything you could possibly want, for a price of course.” You realize that you are not going to get anywhere asking for free information here, everything has a price. Because you do not have any money to spend here, you feel like this is just going to be a dead end.

Disappointed, you turn around just to be immediately confronted by a massive rat standing on its hind legs. It pays no mind to your surprise and asks “Hey, how do you feel about doing a job?”

Following him in, he begins to explain the job “the job is simple, all you have to do is help us by holding a door open, simple job right? Anyways, the pay is good and it shouldn’t take long.” You follow behind him until you approach the door with a different rat holding it open. “Okay, here it is, we only need it open for a minute.” You step in and hold the door for the rat and they hurry off. A few minutes pass and you begin to feel as if you have been tricked, maybe they were just seeing how long you would stand there. Just as you are thinking of leaving, the two rats sprint through the door holding a massive gem. Before you have time to process you are grabbed by guards. They are frog-men that say “Hey, why are you stealing from the king?” Before you can fully understand what just happened they’ve put you into a jail cell. After a few minutes a frog walks in and sits in front of your cell “So, I hear that you have been involved in quite the heist. Odd that you would be an outsider partaking in such an event so I would like to hear your side.” You proceed to tell him you have no idea what just happened and that you were looped into the entire mess. After hearing your side of the story, the frog decides to let you go stating “I believe you; however, you cannot come back to our city until we get this under control. Sorry, but you must leave.” He has you leave the cell and you progress back to the outside world and think that you probably shouldn’t get involved with anything else today.

You make your way through the maze of a city, following the figure through twisting and turning alleyways as you wonder to yourself about who could have possibly designed the city as nothing appears to be linear. Finally, you arrive at a carved wooden door where the suspect knocks 5 times and the door swings open. The suspect quickly rushes in and the door slams behind him. After a few minutes pass you go to the door and repeat the same action, knocking 5 times and are rushed into the room. It’s incredibly dark in the room and you can just see the outlines of individuals surrounding a source of light. Sticking to the edges of the room, you begin making your way to a better viewpoint when you see it. The light is coming from the stolen gem, what luck! You think to yourself, but how are you going to get it out?

As a token of my appreciation we will hold a feast and I will award you with a home within my magnificent kingdom.” After the feast and party, you are shown to your new home where you hope to have more adventures; however, your story for today is at an end.
