    Text: You turn on the flashlight, revealing the surrounding tunnel. It’s massive, the tunnel seems to extend into a few branching systems, and looking back you can barely see the light of day from where you came in. You continue along the tunnel, delving deeper into the system all the while stepping carefully as to not slip on the slime coating the interior of the sewer. As you go in further you begin to feel a slight vibration under your feet; however, you are unable to fully make out where it is coming from. Eager to continue towards the source, you rush forwards down the straight hallway until you come to a branch. To your left is a tunnel that is constantly dripping, you can hear the “plops” of water from deep in the cave and reason there must be much more water further in. On the right, it looks as if the cave is getting shorter, the ceiling steadily comes down and you’ll be forced to crawl through. Would you like to go left or right?

Text:  You head left, hoping to determine the source of the vibrations, but as you continue down the path, you find yourself less and less able to hear or even feel anything. The volume of the “plopping” of water continues to increase, completely drowning out your thoughts as you continue into the tunnel. You think of turning around and heading back where you came from because it is getting to be unbearable, but right as you convince yourself to go back it stops . . . You stop, amazed at how suddenly it got silent as you look forwards and get your bearings. Shining your light, you see a small entrance, eager to get away, you head towards it. 

We could maybe use this as the gateway from the lake to sewers:

Stepping through the entrance you emerge into a beautiful cavern with stalactites formed around a massive pool in the middle. The pool is completely still, with clear water allowing you to peer into its seemingly infinite depths only obscured by massive lilypads lining the surface of the water. Then you feel it. You feel a vibration coming from deep within the pond. Looking closer you see a faint shimmer in the pool. Do you want to go into the pond or try to go around it?

Text: You make your way through the right cave, slowly having to duck down further and further. It gets to a point where you are crawling, having to move slowly to avoid any scrapes. Then you feel a rumbling, this one feels more intense than before, leaving everything around you shaking violently. You feel bits of rubble falling on you from the ceiling and realize you have to start moving faster to get out of the situation. You rush forwards, scraping your knee in the process. Despite the pain, you push through until you make it to an opening. Right as you stand back up and turn to look at where you came through the tunnel behind you collapses. You take a second to survey your surroundings and see two possible ways for you to go now that you cannot go back. You see that there is a set of stairs leading up to a source of natural light above you and in front of you, there is an embroidered door. Which way would you like to go?

As you make it to the other end of the room, you enter a door and hear “Halt!”. You stop in your place and are confronted by two frog guards. “Who goes there?” one asks as they approach. Stunned you are silent, you’ve never seen anything like it. The two beings approaching you are human-sized frogs standing on their hind legs. They come closer and are similarly stunned. “What is that?” you hear one utter. You attempt to retreat just to hear a massive splash behind you. Now you must make a decision, should you go towards the guards or back where the splash came from?

    11 - Towards the guards, forwards

    Text: You reach out towards the gem, and immediately feel the water rumble more intensely and bubbles rise from the depths, surrounding you and pushing you towards the surface. You rise to the surface of the water and swim as fast as you can towards solid footing. Right as you climb back up onto solid ground the pool erupts and drenches you with water. As you clear your eyes you see a massive frog with a tiny crown on its head floating before you. It lets out a colossal “RIBIT” and gazes into your eyes. You are stunned before you can even think the frog booms “What do you think you are doing?” Without giving you time to respond, the frog bellows “why have intruded into my domain? Do you think you can just come into my kingdom and steal from me? Don’t you know I’m the frog king?” You step back in awe as the frog king approaches you. “I am very sorry to do this to you, but you must exit my domain” As soon as he has finished speaking, you are lifted by a geyser of water and pushed out of the sewers.

    Text: You stare in awe at the gem, it unnaturally radiates light, illuminating the area. Looking around, you can see an odd symbol etched into the stone. It’s a square with an inscription: “1st piece”. You think to yourself how odd that is as you swim back towards the surface. As you climb out of the water, you look back into it, only to see a massive object making its way to the surface behind you. You watch petrified, as it surfaces smoothly, hardly making a ripple in the serene waters. It takes you a second to fully comprehend what has emerged, but you soon realize that it is a massive frog with a tiny crown upon its head. It points to you and says “I have not seen a being like you in quite some time, usually we don’t happen upon curious individuals. You are, of course, free to roam my city as you please. Just don’t make too much trouble for my loyal citizens.” He hands you a pin and tells you “that should get you past the guards, please enjoy yourself.” However, as soon as you leave, the king stops you by asking “Would you do me a favor? A week ago someone stole a gem from me similar to the one you saw in the pool. Would you be willing to help me find it, maybe you’ll have more luck with an outside perspective” Would you like to help the frog king?

You notice their attention has briefly shifted away from you, do you run out of the sewers or stay to listen to what the frog king has in store for you?

Thanks again, please be on your way.” You head out, stepping through the doors with your mask on  and into the sprawling underground city. The city is absolutely electric, stepping into it is amazing. Hundreds of citizens consisting of rats, frogs, and a few crocodiles are all moving past eachother completely independently in a seemingly chaotic fashion yet everyone gracefully avoids eachother. You are awestruck for a few seconds before finally snapping out of it. You now need to figure out what happened to the king’s gem. Surveying the area, you believe that there are two best options 1. Go to the bank and investigate to see if there has been any suspicious deposits 2. Go to the market to get a better grasp on what happens in the city

And how did it get access to the king?” However, they do nothing to stop you. You to progress into the city, walking directly into a massive underground kingdom, filled with upright frogs, rats in suits, and even a few crocodiles. Instantly you know that this is where you would like to end your adventure. You step into the city ready to start your new life.

I’ve ruled these parts for quite some time, yet I’ve only seen a few of your kind. What brings you this way?” Stunned by the size of the frog floating before you, you are unable to utter a word. Filling the gap in conversation the king picks up stating: “Whatever brings you here, I am certain we should not be so quick to judge you. After all you haven’t done anything wrong.” You start to feel a bit relieved, as he continues: “I do apologize for this inconvenience, you are free to enjoy the sights of my city, I just ask that you do not make too much trouble for my citizens. Please enjoy yourself. Oh and next time, please use the other door.“ You are free to go now; however, as soon as go to leave, the king stops you by asking “Would you be willing to do me a favor? A week ago someone stole a gem from me similar to this one.” He quickly dives down and produces a massive gem that seems to be emitting light held on a pedestal with a small circle engraving. “Would you be willing to help me find it? my guards have been searching for quite some time and maybe you’ll have more luck with your outside perspective” Would you like to help the frog king?

You finally make it to the front of the line you are met with a teller at the desk who says: “Hello, how may I help you?” You ask about any suspicious activities, more specifically if anyone deposited something massive lately or put a ton of money in an account recently. The teller just gives you a bland “no” and tells you “look, I can’t tell you anything about our clients if you want any information about stuff like that you’ll have to move elsewhere.” Now that you’ve ran into that dead end, would you like to continue your search at the market or return to the king to ask for help?

The buyer then just hops behind the stall and begins to sell his newly acquired stock. You walk up to the man and inquire about any gems being sold. He says “Yeah, of course I know all about gems, see! Look at my selection. I have anything you could possibly want, for a price of course.” You realize that you are not going to get anywhere asking for free information here, everything has a price. Because you do not have any money to spend here, you feel like this is just going to be a dead end. To continue your search would you like to continue your search at the bank or just return to the king to ask for help?

Then you are asked for the passcode; thinking quickly you utter the only phrase that comes to your mind “Purple giraffe lizard!” After confidently stating those words, the person behind the door just says: “Uh, no it’s a knock”. Disappointed, you turn around just to be immediately confronted by a massive rat standing on its hind legs. It pays no mind to your surprise and asks: “Hey, how do you feel about doing a job?” Would you like to accept the job?

Following him in, he begins to explain the job “the job is simple, all you have to do is help us by holding a door open, simple job right? Anyways, the pay is good and it shouldn’t take long.” You follow behind him until you approach the door with a different rat holding it open. “Okay, here it is, we only need it open for a minute.” You step in and hold the door for the rat and they hurry off. A few minutes pass and you begin to feel as if you have been tricked, maybe they were just seeing how long you would stand there. Just as you are thinking of leaving, the two rats sprint through the door holding a massive gem. Before you have time to process you are grabbed by guards. They are frog-men that say “Hey, why are you stealing from the king?” Before you can fully understand what just happened they’ve put you into a jail cell. After a few minutes a frog walks in and sits in front of your cell “So, I hear that you have been involved in quite the heist. Odd that you would be an outsider partaking in such an event so I would like to hear your side.” You proceed to tell him you have no idea what just happened and that you were looped into the entire mess. After hearing your side of the story, the frog decides to let you go stating: “I believe you; however, you cannot come back to our city until we get this under control. Sorry, but you must leave.” He has you leave the cell and you progress back to the outside world and think that you probably shouldn’t get involved with anything else today.

Finally, you arrive at a carved wooden door where the suspect knocks 5 times and the door swings open. The suspect quickly rushes in and the door slams behind him. After a few minutes pass you go to the door and repeat the same action, knocking 5 times and are rushed into the room. It’s incredibly dark in the room and you can just see the outlines of individuals surrounding a source of light. Sticking to the edges of the room, you begin making your way to a better viewpoint when you see it. The light is coming from the stolen gem, what luck! You think to yourself, but how are you going to get it out? Would you like to just walk up and take it? Or would you like to wait for a while?

Once you arrive you walk triumphantly past the guards, holding the gem in front of you to let them know you should be there. Once you arrive in the frog king’s room you present it to him and he lets out a booming “Ribbit, thank you outsider. I knew I could count on you to aid this kingdom. As a token of my appreciation we will hold a feast and I will award you with a home within my magnificent kingdom.” After the feast and party, you are shown to your new home where you hope to have more adventures; however, your story for today is at an end.
