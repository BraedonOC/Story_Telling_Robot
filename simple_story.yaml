          text: You have been walking for days on your way to Bleblob, 
                 the largest town in the region.  At long last you can 
                 see the towers of Bleblob towering over the hills in the distance.  
                 The path stretches out in front of you as you prepare for this day's 
                 journey.  
                 After several hours of walking you come to one of the large rivers that 
                 surround Bleblob.  Where you stand the trail slipts into two paths, one going 
                 to your right towards what appears to be a lake, and one going to your left towards 
                 a bridge.  The bridge looks relatively sturdy and well kept.  The logs it's made out 
                 of appear polished and they sparkle as you tilt your head to look at them.  
                 The lake to your right looks less inviting, but the path towards it is well troden 
                 and confident.  From what you can see of the lake it doesn't look particularly large, 
                 and might provide an alternative path accross the river.

    question: Do you 
                want to go left to the bridge or right towards the lake?

              Small water wheels hang from the bottom of the bridge, slowly turning in the water below.
