      in the region. Where you currently stand the trail slipts
      into two paths, one going to your right towards what appears to be a lake, and
      one going to your left towards a bridge.  The logs it's made out of look weathered 
      but sturdy. The lake to your right looks less inviting,
      but the path towards it is well troden and confident.  From what you can see
      of the lake it doesn't look particularly large, and might provide an alternative
      path accross the river.
